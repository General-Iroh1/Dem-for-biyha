If you were a user that doesn't have permission to branch the peice of code, you would have to fork it!
Unfortunatley i can't fork my own project, so i will explain it to you. (i have tested this on a different repository.)
Look at the top right of your screen, you will see a fork button, if you click it then you clone that repository and you can work on it, on your own.
When you have made your changes, just like you would with a branch, you want to commit the changes, then go on the pull requests button and click on the button 'create pull request'
If the owner accepts your additions, it will be added to the peice of code.
