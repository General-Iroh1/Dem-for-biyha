If i were to make an issue -click the issue button on the top left- then i would be saying to the owner of the repo, there is an issue in your code, here is how to fix it.
Click the 'new issue' button, then i would make a title, add some description then send the issue.
When your issue is sent, the owner of the repo will be able to see it (along with everybody else in the community) and then he can fix the issue by using a keyword 'fix' and then typing your issue tag, the tag would be next to where the issue is.
